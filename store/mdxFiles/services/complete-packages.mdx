Hi everyone! In the past couple of articles, we have been looking at Prisma and Postgres databases.

In this article, I will create a Next.js app that can post data to a Postgres database.

What we'll be building:

- User signs in with Spotify
- User loads their playlists from Spotify
- User can sync one of the playlists to our Postgres database
